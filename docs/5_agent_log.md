# Agent Collaboration Log

Append-only, per master §13. Append after meaningful work: what changed, what was
verified, what is still open. Correct a past entry by adding a new one — never by
rewriting it. Findings that did not hold up are recorded alongside those that did.

## 2026-09-10 — Claude Opus 5 — refactor scoping and Phase 0

**Scope reviewed:** whole repository at `d9ce89e`, audited against the master
standard at `~/Documents/GitHub/coding-standards/`.

**Produced:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-refactor-and-standards-alignment-design.md`
and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-10-phase-0-foundation.md`.

**Verified by running, not asserted:** baseline `uv run pytest` = 19 passed on
Python 3.11; `ruff check .` = 94 findings (48 UP006, 22 E501, 14 I001, 9 UP035,
1 F401); `ruff format --check` = 10 files would be reformatted; `npm run lint`
clean; `npm run build` succeeds. All spec line citations were checked against the
working tree.

**Corrected during review:** five line references in the first draft of the spec
were wrong (`calculate_bmr` is at `meal_recommendation_agent.py:120`, not 113;
the bare `except` is at `main.py:175`, not 170) and were fixed before commit. The
test count was first reported as 13 from a `grep` of `def test`; the real figure
is 19 because of parametrization.

**Open:** Phases 1–4 unplanned. `docs/2_architecture.md` describes an orchestrator
that does not exist yet — the divergence note added in this phase must be removed
when Phase 1 lands it.

## 2026-09-10 — Claude Sonnet 5 — Shape B reshape (Task 4) and review-finding fixes

**Scope:** reshaped `docs/` into Shape B per master §2. `git mv` moved
`docs/product/backend_first_roadmap.md` to `1_brief.md`,
`docs/architecture/system_architecture.md` to `2_architecture.md`, and
`docs/engineering/repo_structure_conventions.md` to `0_coding_standards.md`.
`docs/engineering/coding_standards.md` and `docs/product/react_frontend.md` were
deleted: the former restated the master standard (forbidden by master §13) and
also made a false claim that the supermarket agent uses MCP tooling; the latter's
content was absorbed into `2_architecture.md` and `4_next_steps.md`.

**Corrected during review:** a code-quality review found seven prose-accuracy
defects, all fixed in this same commit:

- `1_brief.md`'s "done looks like" status claimed only the fourth exit criterion
  was open. Verified by running `grep -rn "response_model" backend/app/` (no
  match) and `grep -n "-> dict\[str, Any\]" backend/app/main.py` (all 8 routes)
  and inspecting `backend/app/repositories/storage.py` (three plain classes, no
  `Protocol`/ABC): criteria 1 and 3 are also open, not just 4. Fixed to name 1, 3
  and 4.
- `2_architecture.md` linked `4_next_steps.md` §3 for the remaining structural
  moves; §3 is "Phase 3 — Tests and CI". Fixed to §5, "Remaining structural
  moves", which is the correct section.
- `docs/agents/supermarket_agent.md` still describes MCP-based Mapping and
  Grocery/Inventory API tools. Verified by inspecting
  `backend/app/agents/supermarket_agent.py`: `_locate_nearest_store`,
  `_map_inventory_and_price` and `_estimate_category_and_price` are all local
  reference tables, and `maps_api_key` is stored but never used — no MCP tooling
  exists anywhere in this repo. The agent doc itself is retained deliberately as
  design intent, but `2_architecture.md` now carries a caveat sentence where it
  links that doc, and `4_next_steps.md` §5 now has an item to implement or
  correct it.
- `0_coding_standards.md` had a bullet restating master §8's "never commit raw
  data" rule almost verbatim — exactly the kind of duplication master §13
  forbids and the reason `docs/engineering/coding_standards.md` was deleted.
  Deleted that one bullet.
- `1_brief.md`'s Workflow section said it was the single reference and told
  readers not to restate it elsewhere, which contradicted `2_architecture.md`
  §4 (Data Flow Protocol) legitimately restating the same flow in
  implementation terms. Softened to say §4 restates it in implementation terms
  rather than forbidding restatement.
- `docs/superpowers/` — which holds the specs and plans for this refactor — was
  missing from the `docs/` subtree listed in both `2_architecture.md` and
  `README.md`. Added to both.

**Also verified:** `docs/engineering/repo_structure_conventions.md` — renamed to
`0_coding_standards.md` in this task, not deleted — carried a "Current-to-Target
Migration" list prefaced with "the repository now follows most of the target
package layout." Re-checked each of its six items against the working tree:
none is actually complete except the supermarket agent itself (route handlers
are still in `main.py`, no `backend/app/api/` exists; response models still
live beside the agents that return them, not in `schemas/`; USDA/FatSecret
clients are still inside `agents/nutrition_verification_agent.py`, not
`services/`; `repositories/storage.py` is still one module; `ml/` is still
empty). That "follows most of the target layout" framing was optimistic and is
why the rewritten `0_coding_standards.md` drops it and `4_next_steps.md` §5
instead tracks each move as open work, mostly unchecked.

**Verified by running, not asserted:** `uv run pytest` = 19 passed; `uv run ruff
check .` = All checks passed; `git diff 437d228 HEAD --stat -- ':!docs'
':!README.md'` produced empty output, confirming this task touched only `docs/`
and `README.md`.

**Open:** all items in `4_next_steps.md` §5, including the new supermarket-agent
doc item, remain unimplemented.
